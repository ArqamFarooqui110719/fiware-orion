# <a name="top"></a>NGSIv2 Implementation Notes

* [Deprecated features](#deprecated-features)

This document describes some considerations to take into account
regarding the specific implementation done by Orion Context Broker
of the [NGSIv2 specification](http://telefonicaid.github.io/fiware-orion/api/v2/stable/).

## Deprecated features

Although we try to minimize the changes in the stable version of the NGSIv2 specification, a few changes
have been needed in the end. Thus, there is changed functionality that doesn't appear in the current
NGSIv2 stable specification document but that Orion still supports
(as [deprecated functionality](../deprecated.md)) in order to keep backward compatibility.

In particular:

* The usage of `dateCreated` and `dateModified` in the `options` parameter (introduced
in stable RC-2016.05 and removed in RC-2016.10) is still supported, e.g. `options=dateModified`. However,
you are highly encouraged to use `attrs` instead (i.e. `attrs=dateModified,*`).

* `POST /v2/op/update` accepts the same action types as NGSIv1, that is `APPEND`, `APPEND_STRICT`,
`UPDATE`, `DELETE` and `REPLACE`. However, they shouldn't be used, preferring always the following counterparts:
`append`, `appendStrict`, `update`, `delete` and `replace`.

* `attributes` field in `POST /v2/op/query` is deprecated. It is a combination of `attrs` (to select
which attributes to include in the response to the query) and unary attribute filter in `q` within
`expression` (to return only entities which have these attributes). Use them instead.
