This document describes some considerations to take into account
regarding the specific implementation done by Orion Context Broker
of the [NGSIv2 specification](http://telefonicaid.github.io/fiware-orion/api/v2/stable/).

## Subscription payload validations

The particular validations that Orion implements on NGSIv2 subscription payloads are the following ones:

* **description**: optional (max length 1024)
* **subject**: mandatory
    * **entities**: mandatory
        * **id** or **idPattern**: one of them is mandatory (but both at the same time is not allowed). id
            must follow NGSIv2 restrictions for IDs. idPattern must be not empty and a valid regex.
        * **type** or **typePattern**: optional (but both at the same time is not allowed). type must 
            follow NGSIv2 restrictions for IDs. type must not be empty. typePattern must be a valid regex, and non-empty.
    * **condition**: optional (but if present it must have a content, i.e. `{}` is not allowed)
        * **attrs**: optional (but if present it must be a list; empty list is allowed)
        * **expression**: optional (but if present it must have a content, i.e. `{}` is not allowed)
            * **q**: optional (but if present it must be not empty, i.e. `""` is not allowed)
            * **mq**: optional (but if present it must be not empty, i.e. `""` is not allowed)
            * **georel**: optional (but if present it must be not empty, i.e. `""` is not allowed)
            * **geometry**: optional (but if present it must be not empty, i.e. `""` is not allowed)
            * **coords**: optional (but if present it must be not empty, i.e. `""` is not allowed)
* **notification**:
    * **http**: must be present if `httpCustom` is omitted, forbidden otherwise
        * **url**: mandatory (must be a valid URL)
    * **httpCustom**: must be present if `http` is omitted, forbidden otherwise
        * **url**: mandatory (must be not empty)
        * **headers**: optional (but if present it must have a content, i.e. `{}` is not allowed)
        * **qs**: optional (but if present it must have a content, i.e. `{}` is not allowed)
        * **method**: optional (but if present it must be a valid HTTP method)
        * **payload**: optional (empty string is allowed)
    * **attrs**: optional (but if present it must be a list; empty list is allowed)
    * **metadata**: optional (but if present it must be a list; empty list is allowed)
    * **exceptAttrs**: optional (but it cannot be present if `attrs` is also used; if present it must be a non-empty list)
    * **attrsFormat**: optional (but if present it must be a valid attrs format keyword)
* **throttling**: optional (must be an integer)
* **expires**: optional (must be a date or empty string "")
* **status**: optional (must be a valid status keyword)

## Deprecated features

Although we try to minimize the changes in the stable version of the NGSIv2 specification, a few changes
have been needed in the end. Thus, there is changed functionality that doesn't appear in the current
NGSIv2 stable specification document but that Orion still supports
(as [deprecated functionality](../deprecated.md)) in order to keep backward compatibility.

In particular:

* The usage of `dateCreated` and `dateModified` in the `options` parameter (introduced
in stable RC-2016.05 and removed in RC-2016.10) is still supported, e.g. `options=dateModified`. However,
you are highly encouraged to use `attrs` instead (i.e. `attrs=dateModified,*`).

* `POST /v2/op/update` accepts the same action types as NGSIv1, that is `APPEND`, `APPEND_STRICT`,
`UPDATE`, `DELETE` and `REPLACE`. However, they shouldn't be used, preferring always the following counterparts:
`append`, `appendStrict`, `update`, `delete` and `replace`.

* `attributes` field in `POST /v2/op/query` is deprecated. It is a combination of `attrs` (to select
which attributes to include in the response to the query) and unary attribute filter in `q` within
`expression` (to return only entities which have these attributes). Use them instead.
