- Add: ignoreType metadata so Orion ignores attribute type semantic (supported by geo-types at the present moment) (#4032)
- Fix: attribute update doesn't override metadata by default (new option overridenMetadata has to be used for that) (#4033)
- Fix: unify error traces with "Runtime Error" (some of them where using "Internal Error" or "Orion Bug")
- Fix: increase severity to ERROR in some WARN traces actually meaning Runtime Error conditions
- Fix: ForwardingError alarm logic, which was missing in some cases
