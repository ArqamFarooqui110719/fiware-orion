- Fix: throttling misbehaviour after subscription update when csubs cache is in use (#3981)
- Fix: lastNotification missed some times in GET /v2/subscriptions/{id} and GET /v2/subscriptions
- Hardening: refactor PATCH /v2/subscriptions/{subId} logic avoiding some potential crash situation (although very rare) accessing to csub cache
